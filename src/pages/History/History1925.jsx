The entire performance is broadcast over the radio. As the flagship home of the premier maker of pianos, Steinway & Sons, Steinway Hall includes acoustically ideal rooms for musical performances by such virtuosos as Sergei Rachmaninoff and Vladimir Horowitz, as well as spaces for making and tuning instruments.`}
